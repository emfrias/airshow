In the future, we'll want a map display with aircraft on it.

For aircraft outlines there are a few sources:
 - tar1090 has them in sprite form, https://github.com/adsbfi/tar1090/blob/master/html/images/sprites.png
   with https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/blob/974f1068c7906dd9764a06a2953250a5b02e407a/html/markers.js
 - dump1090-mutability has svg icons (I think these were used as the source for at least a few of the ones
   in tar1090: https://github.com/adsb-related-code/dump1090-mutability/blob/master/public_html/markers.js
